<h2 class="main">
File exists
</h2>
<p>
You can specify the action to perform if a file by the same name already exists:
<br /><br />
Rename will add a new file with a version number added/incremented:
<br />
So filename_12345.doc (where 12345 is the user id) would become filename_1_12345.doc
(where 1 is the first version uploaded with the same name)
<br /><br />
Replace will overwrite the old file with the new one.
<br /><br />
Skip will skip the upload of that file and leave the old one in place.
